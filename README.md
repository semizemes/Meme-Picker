# Learning Progress — Scrimba JavaScript Course

This repository contains the starter files uploaded from the Scrimba JavaScript course.  
As I continue learning, I will be adding new features, small projects, and functionality to practice each concept.

## Concepts Learned Along the Way

### JavaScript

- **`for…of`** — looping through arrays, NodeLists, and iterable objects.
- **Radio & Checkbox Inputs** — reading selected values and handling multiple-choice inputs.
- **`getElementsByClassName`** — selecting multiple elements by class name.
- **`querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`** — modern and flexible ways to select elements.
- **`classList.remove`** — updating UI by removing classes dynamically.
- **`import` / `export`** — working with JavaScript modules for cleaner and modular code structure.
- **`.includes()`** — checking whether a value exists inside an array or string.

## Purpose of This Repository

This is my learning space.  
I will expand these files as I progress, experimenting with new techniques and building small components that help strengthen my JavaScript and front-end skills.
